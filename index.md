##Introduction
I am a Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science, Fudan University since Fall 2012. My advisor is Prof. Min Yang, leader of System Software and Security Lab, and Ministry of science and technology "973" project Chief Scientist. Part of my work is also supervised by Prof. [Guofei Gu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/) from [Texas A&M University](http://a), and Prof. [Xiaofeng Wang](http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/xw7/) from Indiana University at Bloomington. Before I came to Fudan, I got my B.E. degree in School of Information, Hainan University of China.

My research interest is security and privacy in mobile applications. To solve practical realted problems, I would like to use program analysis tecniniques, as well as machine learning, NLP, etc. The topics I am currently working on include

- Privacy-leakage detection
- User-Input privacy detection and protection in mobile applications
- Malware trend analysis
- Privacy-related behaviors analysis on mobile users

##Misc.
In spare time, I like to watch movies with good stroies, and all kinds of documentaries about natural, science, and social. I'm also a fan of travelling and driving. I have driven to most places around Shanghai. On every trip, I intend to discover a refreshed, better "inner myself".☺
